## Puzzle 1
Your flight to the major airline hub reaches cruising altitude without incident. While you consider checking the in-flight menu for one of those drinks that come with a little umbrella, you are interrupted by the kid sitting next to you.

Their handheld game console won't turn on! They ask if you can take a look.

You narrow the problem down to a strange **infinite loop** in the boot code (your puzzle input) of the device. You should be able to fix it, but first you need to be able to run the code in isolation.

The boot code is represented as a text file with one **instruction** per line of text. Each instruction consists of an **operation** (```acc```, ```jmp```, or ```nop```) and an **argument** (a signed number like ```+4``` or ```-20```).

* ```acc``` increases or decreases a single global value called the **accumulator** by the value given in the argument. For example, ```acc +7``` would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at ```0```. After an ```acc``` instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.
* ```jmp``` **jumps** to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an **offset** from the ```jmp``` instruction; for example, ```jmp +2``` would skip the next instruction, ```jmp +1``` would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and ```jmp -20``` would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.
* ```nop``` stands for **No OPeration** - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it is executed next.

```
nop +0
acc +1
jmp +4
acc +3
jmp -3
acc -99
acc +1
jmp -4
acc +6
```

These instructions are visited in this order:

```
nop +0  | 1
acc +1  | 2, 8(!)
jmp +4  | 3
acc +3  | 6
jmp -3  | 7
acc -99 |
acc +1  | 4
jmp -4  | 5
acc +6  |
```

First, the ```nop +0``` does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (```acc +1```) and ```jmp +4``` sets the next instruction to the other ```acc +1``` near the bottom. After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, ```jmp -4``` executes, setting the next instruction to the only ```acc +3```. It sets the accumulator to 5, and ```jmp -3``` causes the program to continue back at the first ```acc +1```.

This is an **infinite loop**: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the program tries to run any instruction a second time, you know it will never terminate.

Immediately **before** the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator is **5**.

Run your copy of the boot code. Immediately before any instruction is executed a second time, **what value is in the accumulator**?

## Puzzle 2
It's getting pretty expensive to fly these days - not because of ticket prices, but because of the ridiculous number of bags you need to buy!

Consider again your ```shiny gold``` bag and the rules from the above example:

```
light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
faded blue bags contain no other bags.
dotted black bags contain no other bags.
```

* ```faded blue``` bags contain ```0``` other bags.
* ```dotted black``` bags contain ```0``` other bags.
* ```vibrant plum``` bags contain ```11``` other bags: 5 ```faded blue``` bags and 6 ```dotted black``` bags.
* ```dark olive``` bags contain 7 other bags: 3 ```faded blue``` bags and 4 ```dotted black``` bags.

So, a single ```shiny gold``` bag must contain 1 ```dark olive``` bag (and the 7 bags within it) plus 2 ```vibrant plum``` bags (and the 11 bags within each of those): ```1 + 1*7 + 2 + 2*11``` = ```32``` bags!

Of course, the actual rules have a small chance of going several levels deeper than this example; be sure to count all of the bags, even if the nesting becomes topologically impractical!

Here's another example:

```
shiny gold bags contain 2 dark red bags.
dark red bags contain 2 dark orange bags.
dark orange bags contain 2 dark yellow bags.
dark yellow bags contain 2 dark green bags.
dark green bags contain 2 dark blue bags.
dark blue bags contain 2 dark violet bags.
dark violet bags contain no other bags.
```

In this example, a ```single shiny``` gold bag must contain ```126``` other bags.

**How many individual bags are required inside your single ```shiny gold``` bag**?
