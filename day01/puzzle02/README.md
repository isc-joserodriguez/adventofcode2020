# Day 01: Report Repair | Puzzle 2
The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find **_three_** numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.

```
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
```

Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to **_2020_** are **_979_**, **_366_**, and **_675_**. Multiplying them together produces the answer, ```241861950```.

**In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to _2020_?**
